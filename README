Asked for 100 common coding interview problems
Asked common coding interview questions
extracted only coding problems from interview questions
loaded each problem into template with more information for each problem

TODO:
each solution has no bad input check, to ilustrate solution to algorithm and not bad input
maybe make them all check for bad input

is algorithm common in literature
what type of topic is covered if so (so you can learn)

problem difficulty, (to solve easier ones or harder ones first, like rating)

while learning theory of programming for each topic, you could be solving coding problems for each (how to...)

create title for each problem

multiple input examples or an input example generator function

if it is a big topic: what is the point of it or... what are they used for

for example: linked list- efficient insertion and deletion of data, used on stacks queues graphs
